**What it does**

SOAPdenovo is a novel short-read assembly method that can build a de novo draft assembly for the human-sized genomes. The program is specially designed to assemble Illumina GA short reads. It creates new opportunities for building reference sequences and carrying out accurate analyses of unexplored genomes in a cost effective way.

For more information, check the `user manual <https://github.com/aquaskyline/SOAPdenovo2>`_.

Before execution of any command, you need to generate a configuration file with the dedicated tool.
